# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Twitter-Data-using-Machine-Learning
# Problem Statement: 
Analyzing sentiments on Twitter, a platform with diverse content, poses a challenge due to the presence of mixed sentiments. Traditional models face limitations, and there's a growing need for improved accuracy using advanced machine learning techniques.
# Approach: 
Employed text preprocessing techniques and the Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm to categorize tweet polarity as positive or negative. Utilized a Kaggle dataset, incorporating unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams for feature extraction, and observed the impact on sentiment analysis accuracy.
# Conclusion: 
Leveraging machine learning methods, particularly the Naive Bayes Classifier, and incorporating diverse features like bigrams, enhanced sentiment analysis accuracy to 76.78%, addressing challenges posed by mixed sentiments in Twitter data.
